PROJECT 1: At the end of this lesson I propose you to create the flow chart for a simple procedure and post it to the community for review and discussion: get a series of numbers as input from the command line. The program keeps accepting values until the user writes the number 0, and it will print the highest number, the average and the smallest number

PROJECT 2: I want you to think of a simple application. A very simple one, to start with, and use the system described in this module to gather the requirements, a simple analysis and draw some mockups. Share your work in the community. You need to think about building the website for a train company. You have to store the train routes, train types (high speed, local, ..) and the time table. Users can search for a specific departure and arrival stations, and for the departure time. Show the available trains and let them book tickets. Do an analysis of the requirements and try to design the mockup of 3/4 screens and start imagining the application. How it should look, what each screen should present to the users.
